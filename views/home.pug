    h3 Ingredients:
    div#pancake_recipe
      ul
        li 1 tbs white vinegar
        li 1 cup unsweetened almond milk
        li 2 cups rolled oats
        li 1 medium ripe banana
        li 2 tsp baking powder
        li 1/2 tsp baking soda
        li 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
        li 1/2 tsp salt
        li 3 tbs sugar
        li 2 tsp vanilla extract

    h3 Instructions:
    ol
      li Add the vinegar to a 1-cup or larger liquid measuring cup. Pour in enough almond milk to make 1 cup total. Set aside for about 5 minutes.
      li Meanwhile, grind the oats into a flour by adding them to the pitcher of a blender and pulsing until fine.
      li Add the remaining ingredients to the blender. Puree, scraping down the sides once or twice if necessary, until completely combined.
      li Let the batter rest for about 5 minutes.
      li Heat a griddle or non-stick frying pan to about 160 degrees Celsius (medium heat). It’s hot enough when you sprinkle a couple drops of water onto the surface and the drops dance around. If the griddle/pan is nonstick, you shouldn’t need any oil/vegan butter. Otherwise, you may want to melt a little oil into the pan before cooking the pancakes. Pour approx. 1/3 cup per pancake onto the griddle or pan (the pancakes will be 4-5 inches in diameter). Cook for 1-2 minutes until the pancakes look dry around the edges and a little bubbly. Flip and cook on the other side until golden brown and cooked in the middle. If the pancakes brown before the middle is cooked through, try lowering your heat a bit.
      li Serve with toppings of your choice.

    h3 Ingredients:
    div#chocolate_chip_cookies_recipe
      ul
        li 2 cups all-purpose flour
        li 1 tsp baking powder
        li 3/4 tsp baking soda
        li 1/2 tsp fine salt
        li 1 cup dark chocolate chips
        li 1/2 cup sugar
        li 1/2 cup dark brown sugar
        li 1/2 cup canola oil
        li 1/4 cup water

    h3 Instructions:
    ol
      li In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the chocolate chips to the flour mixture and toss to coat.
      li In a separate large bowl, whisk the sugars briskly with the canola oil and water until smooth and incorporated, about 2 minutes. Note: Use fresh, soft light brown sugar. If there are clumps, break them up with the back of a spoon or your hand before whisking.
      li Add the flour mixture to the sugar mixture, and then stir with a wooden spoon or a rubber spatula until just combined and no flour is visible. Do not overmix.
      li Cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough for at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours. Do not skip this step.
      li Preheat the oven to 175 degrees Celsius. Line two rimmed sheet pans with parchment paper. Remove dough from the refrigerator and use an ice cream scoop or a spoon to portion dough into 2-inch mounds. We recommend freezing the balls of dough for 10 minutes before baking as the cookies will retain their shape better while baking.
      li Sprinkle the balls of dough with coarse-grained sea salt (if freezing, remove balls of dough from the freezer first), and bake for 12 to 13 minutes, or until the edges are just golden. Do not overbake.

    div#chocolate_babka
      ul
        li 3/4 cup soy milk
        li 2 tsp instant dry yeast
        li 1/4 cup coconut sugar
        li 2 cups flour
        li 1/2 tsp salt
        li 1/3 cup coconut oil, softened
        li 2 tbs vegan butter, softened
        li 1/2 cup coconut sugar
        li 3/2 tbs cacao
        li 1 tsp ground cinnamon
        li 1/4 tsp salt
        li 2 tbs coconut oil, softened
        li 2 tbs vegan butter, softened
        li 1/3 cup chocolate chips
        li 1 tbs coconut sugar
        li 3/2 tbs water

    h3 Instructions:
    ol
      li Make the dough. In a jug, warm the soy milk to 37°C-45°C, which is the perfect temperature to activate yeast in. Add the yeast and 1 teaspoon of the coconut sugar. Leave to activate for 10 minutes. You will know it's ready when the mix forms a layer of foam on the top. If it doesn't, check to see if your yeast is past its used by date or wait a little longer.
      li In the mixing bowl of a stand mixer, add the rest of the coconut sugar, flour and salt. Using your fingertips, rub in the softened coconut oil and vegan butter. On a low speed with the dough hook attached, begin mixing the dry ingredients. Slowly add the wet ingredients. Knead for 8-10 minutes, until it bounces back when lightly touched. You can knead by hand if you don't own a stand mixer.
      li Transfer the dough to a greased bowl, cover with a tea towel and place in a warm area to prove for 40-60 minutes or until doubled in size. Here's what I do. Preheat my oven to 40°C, turn it off and place the bowl in there with the oven door closed.
      li Meanwhile make the filling. In a small bowl, stir all the ingredients together except for the chocolate chips. Place to one side.
      li Assemble loaf. Line and lightly grease a bread tin. After the dough has doubled in size, place on a lightly floured surface and knead a few times to knock back the air. Roll out to an even 30x40cm/ 12"x16" rectangle. I used my ruler for this. Spread the filling over the top, leaving a 1.5cm/ ½" gap all around the sides. Sprinkle over the chocolate chips.
      li Tightly roll the dough to form a 40cm long log. Cut 1.5cm/ ½" off both ends. Gently cut the log in half lengthways and have the cut sides facing up. Begin to twirl together. Pinch and twirl the bottom end together to keep the dough in place (refer to pictures). Lift one side over the over, to form a twist. Always keeping the cut sides facing up. Carefully transfer the bread into the greased bread tin. Mine was long enough to form an "S" in the tin, tucking the edges into the openings (refer to pictures). During the second proving and baking, all the small gaps will be filled. Cover with with a tea towel and place in a warm area for another 60-90 minutes to double in size.
      li Preheat the oven to 160°C fan forced. Bake babka for 40-45 minutes, until golden in appearance. Remove from oven, brush with sugar syrup and leave to cool in the tin for 10 minutes before removing and serving warm.
      li To make sugar syrup, combine the coconut sugar and water in a small saucepan . Leave to boil over a medium high heat. Once the sugar dissolves remove from heat.
