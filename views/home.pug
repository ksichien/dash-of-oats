    p.serves Serves: #[input(type='number', id='quantity0', value='1', min='1', max='10')]
    h3 Ingredients:
    div#pancake_recipe
      ul
        li 1 tbs white vinegar
        li 7/8 cup unsweetened almond milk
        li 2 cups rolled oats
        li 1 medium ripe banana
        li 2 tsp baking powder
        li 1/2 tsp baking soda
        li 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
        li 1/2 tsp salt
        li 3 tbs maple syrup
        li 2 tsp vanilla extract

    h3 Instructions:
    ol
      li Add the vinegar to a 1-cup or larger liquid measuring cup. Pour in enough almond milk to make 1 cup total. Set aside for about 5 minutes.
      li Meanwhile, grind the oats into a flour by adding them to the pitcher of a blender and pulsing until fine.
      li Add the remaining ingredients to the blender. Puree, scraping down the sides once or twice if necessary, until completely combined.
      li Let the batter rest for about 5 minutes.
      li Heat a griddle or non-stick frying pan to about 325 degrees Fahrenheit (medium heat). It’s hot enough when you sprinkle a couple drops of water onto the surface and the drops dance around. If the griddle/pan is nonstick, you shouldn’t need any oil/vegan butter. Otherwise, you may want to melt a little oil into the pan before cooking the pancakes. Pour approx. 1/3 cup per pancake onto the griddle or pan (the pancakes will be 4-5 inches in diameter). Cook for 1-2 minutes until the pancakes look dry around the edges and a little bubbly. Flip and cook on the other side until golden brown and cooked in the middle. If the pancakes brown before the middle is cooked through, try lowering your heat a bit.
      li Serve with toppings of your choice.

    p.serves Serves: #[input(type='number', id='quantity1', value='1', min='1', max='10')]
    h3 Ingredients:
    div#energybar_recipe
      ul
        li 1 cup rolled oats
        li 1 cup pitted dates
        li 1/4 cup shredded coconut
        li 1/2 cup of your chosen ingredients (dried fruit, nuts, seeds)
        li 1 tbs coconut oil

    h3 Instructions:
    ol
      li Soak the dates in room temperature water for at least 10 minutes, ideally longer.
      li Line a baking tray with some baking parchment that is twice it’s length so that half rolls off one end.
      li Put your oats and other ingredients in a large bowl.
      li Drain and wash the dates and put in a food processor. Blend until they have turned into a sticky paste. Persevere here – it will blend! If it needs a little help add 1/2 – 1 tbsp of melted coconut oil.
      li Once blended add to the oat mix.
      li Once loosely blended turn it out on to the baking tray and flatten slightly. Fold the other half of the parchment over the mixture and flatten with your hands. Use a rolling pin to flatten it out completely into a square or rectangle, using your hands to mould and straighten the edges.
      li Put in the fridge for at least two hours to allow to set. Once set use a knife to cut into bars.
