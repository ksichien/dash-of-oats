    h3 Ingredients:
    div#energy_bars
      ul
        li 1 cup rolled oats
        li 1 cup pitted dates
        li 1/4 cup shredded coconut
        li 1/2 cup of your chosen ingredients (dried fruit, nuts, seeds)
        li 1 tbs coconut oil

    h3 Instructions:
    ol
      li Soak the dates in room temperature water for at least 10 minutes, ideally longer.
      li Line a baking tray with some baking parchment that is twice it’s length so that half rolls off one end.
      li Put your oats and other ingredients in a large bowl.
      li Drain and wash the dates and put in a food processor. Blend until they have turned into a sticky paste. Persevere here – it will blend! If it needs a little help add 1/2 – 1 tbsp of melted coconut oil.
      li Once blended add to the oat mix.
      li Once loosely blended turn it out on to the baking tray and flatten slightly. Fold the other half of the parchment over the mixture and flatten with your hands. Use a rolling pin to flatten it out completely into a square or rectangle, using your hands to mould and straighten the edges.
      li Put in the fridge for at least two hours to allow to set. Once set use a knife to cut into bars.
